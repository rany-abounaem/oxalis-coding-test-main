# Oxalis Coding Test

## 1. Thought Process

I started with the generalist and back-end tasks since those are more related to the role.
**My main goal was to get as many tasks done as I could in the shortest period of time.** Afterwards, polishing code should be the next step (haven't done it yet).
I managed to achieve this goal and finalized **ALL** tasks in 3 days of work time and 4 days from the day of receiving task.

## 2. Task Duration

I tracked time spent on each bundle of tasks under a single task type.

- Generalist: 0.5 days.
- Back-end: 1.5 days.
- Client: 1 day.

## 3. Code Comments

Please check the comments for each subtask where I have written a comment that tags a line or a code snippet with their corresponding subtask requirement.

## 4. Possible Future Optimizations

- Client: Object pooling, SOLID principles, observer pattern and eliminating any singleton dependencies.
- Generalist: Switch HTTP polling for WebSocket communication.
- Back-end: Optimize folder structure and routes, support WebSockets communication.

## 5. Final Note

I enjoyed working on the task. I like immersing myself in a codebase where every piece of the puzzle gets connected by implementing back-end and frontend systems that communicate together seamlessly.
It was an amazing experience that enabled me to showcase my skills and creativity.
